# FOURCAMP
Small programs made at FOURCAMP, the learning program FOURSYS provides for some of their new hires.
These are all common training pratices for novice developers. The objective was to train programming logic, so they lack "try-catch" blocks or even user made methods in most cases. They were all made using C# and VS Community.
